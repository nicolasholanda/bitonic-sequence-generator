## About
This project is based on the [article about generating bitonic sequences](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/generate-bitonic-sequence-of-length-n-from-integers-in-a-given-range/), 


## What is a bitonic sequence
It's a numeric sequency where the first case grows and degrees from a max point or from the min point. In short it have a max and min point "Example: {1, 5, 6, 9, 8, 7, 3, 0}"

## The problem
With at least 3 integers (N, L, R) we need to generate a bitonic sequency using N numbers on the interval (L,R) in a way where the sequency strict grows and then decrease, the first element of the seuqency must be the max possible. If not possible to build the sequency it must return -1.
