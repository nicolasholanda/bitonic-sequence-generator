## ðŸŽ¬ Script

### **[0:00 - 0:30] Opening - The Problem** (30 seconds)

**Speaker:**
> "Good morning/afternoon everyone! Today I'm presenting our **Bitonic Sequence Generator** - a high-performance web API built in Haskell.
>
> First, what's a **bitonic sequence**? It's a sequence that first increases, then decreases - like going up and down a mountain. For example: [3, 5, 8, 10, 7, 4, 1].
>
> Our challenge was to build a scalable API that generates these sequences with specific constraints, handles errors gracefully, and caches results for performance."

**Visual**: Show the GitHub repository homepage.

---

### **[0:30 - 1:30] Live Demo** (1 minute)

**Speaker:**
> "Let me show you what it does. The API is running on port 3000."

**Action 1**: Open Postman/terminal and show a successful request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/bitonic \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"n": 5, "l": 1, "r": 10}'
```

**Show response:**
```json
{
  "request": {"n": 5, "l": 1, "r": 10},
  "result": [7, 9, 10, 8, 6]
}
```

**Speaker:**
> "The request specifies: generate a bitonic sequence of length 5, with values between 1 and 10. The API responds with the input parameters and the generated sequence."

**Action 2**: Show caching by repeating the same request:

**Speaker:**
> "Notice the response time - it's instant because we're using **Redis caching**. Let me check Redis..."

**Action 3**: Switch to Redis CLI and run:
```bash
KEYS *
GET "bitonic:5:1:10"
```

**Speaker:**
> "There it is - the cached result. First request generates and caches, subsequent requests are served from cache."

**Action 4**: Show error handling:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/bitonic \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"n": -5, "l": 1, "r": 10}'
```

**Show response:**
```json
{
  "errorMessage": "n must be greater than 0",
  "errorCode": "INVALID_REQUEST"
}
```

**Speaker:**
> "The API validates input and returns proper HTTP status codes - 400 for invalid parameters, 503 if Redis is down, 500 for unexpected errors."

---

### **[1:30 - 3:00] Architecture Overview** (1.5 minutes)

**Speaker:**
> "Now let's talk about the architecture. We followed **clean architecture principles** with clear separation of concerns."

**Visual**: Show the architecture diagram from DEV-README.md (or draw it).

**Speaker:**
> "We have eight layers, each with a single responsibility:
>
> 1. **HTTP Layer** (BitonicController) - Handles routes and HTTP requests
> 2. **Error Translation** (ApiError) - Converts business errors to HTTP responses
> 3. **Business Logic** (BitonicService) - Validates input and orchestrates operations
> 4. **Data Access** (BitonicRepository) - Redis caching operations
> 5. **Core Algorithm** (BitonicSequence) - Pure function that generates sequences
> 6. **Models** (BitonicModels) - Data structures shared across layers
> 7. **Infrastructure** (AppContext) - Dependency injection and environment setup
> 8. **Bootstrap** (Main) - Application entry point
>
> The key insight here is **no layer knows about layers above it**. The repository doesn't know about HTTP, the service doesn't know about status codes. This makes the code testable, maintainable, and scalable."

**Visual**: Highlight the data flow: HTTP â†’ Service â†’ Repository â†’ Redis

### **[3:00 - 4:30] Code Walkthrough - Why Haskell?** (1.5 minutes)

**Speaker:**
> "You might be wondering - **why Haskell?** Let me show you three powerful features that make this code bulletproof."

#### **Feature 1: Type Safety** (30 seconds)

**Action**: Open `BitonicModels.hs`

**Speaker:**
> "First, **type safety**. Look at our data models:
>
> ```haskell
> data BitonicRequest = BitonicRequest
>     { n :: Int
>     , l :: Int  
>     , r :: Int
>     } deriving (Generic, Show)
> ```
>
> With just `deriving (Generic)`, we get automatic JSON serialization and deserialization. The compiler guarantees that every request has these three integer fields - no null pointer exceptions, no undefined fields."

#### **Feature 2: Error Handling Without Exceptions** (30 seconds)

**Action**: Open `BitonicService.hs`

**Speaker:**
> "Second, **explicit error handling** using the `Either` type:
>
> ```haskell
> generateBitonic :: BitonicRequest 
>                 -> AppM (Either ServiceError BitonicResponse)
> ```
>
> The return type **Either ServiceError BitonicResponse** means this function can either return an error OR a response. No hidden exceptions - the type signature tells you exactly what can happen. The compiler forces us to handle both cases."

#### **Feature 3: Dependency Injection with ReaderT** (30 seconds)

**Action**: Open `AppContext.hs`

**Speaker:**
> "Third, **elegant dependency injection** using the ReaderT pattern:
>
> ```haskell
> type AppM = ReaderT AppEnv IO
> ```
>
> Instead of passing the Redis connection through every layer (which would be messy), we wrap our operations in this `AppM` monad. Any function using `AppM` can access the environment with `asks envRedisConn`. It's like dependency injection in Spring, but at the type level."

---

### **[4:30 - 5:30] Key Design Patterns** (1 minute)

**Speaker:**
> "Let me highlight three design patterns we used that might be new to you."

#### **Pattern 1: Pure Functions** (20 seconds)

**Action**: Open `BitonicSequence.hs`

**Speaker:**
> "The core algorithm is a **pure function** - same input always produces the same output, no side effects:
>
> ```haskell
> bitonicArray :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Maybe [Int]
> ```
>
> This makes it trivially testable and impossible to have hidden dependencies."

#### **Pattern 2: Pattern Matching** (20 seconds)

**Action**: Show `ApiError.hs`

**Speaker:**
> "We use **pattern matching** extensively instead of if-else chains:
>
> ```haskell
> toHttpStatus (InvalidRequest _) = status400
> toHttpStatus (ServiceUnavailable _) = status503
> toHttpStatus (InternalError _) = status500
> ```
>
> The compiler ensures we handle ALL cases - if we add a new error type and forget to handle it, the code won't compile."

#### **Pattern 3: Monadic Composition** (20 seconds)

**Action**: Show `BitonicController.hs`

**Speaker:**
> "We chain operations using **do notation** - it's like async/await in JavaScript:
>
> ```haskell
> post "/bitonic" $ do
>     req <- jsonData
>     result <- liftIO $ runApp env (generateBitonic req)
>     case result of
>         Right response -> json response
>         Left err -> handleServiceError err
> ```
>
> Each line depends on the previous, but it reads sequentially and handles errors explicitly."

---

### **[5:30 - 6:30] Testing & Quality Assurance** (1 minute)

**Speaker:**
> "We have comprehensive test coverage with four test suites."

**Action**: Run tests in terminal:
```bash
cabal test
```

**Speaker:**
> "We test:
>
> 1. **Unit tests** for the core algorithm - pure functions are easy to test
> 2. **Service tests** with mocked Redis - test business logic in isolation
> 3. **Repository tests** with real Redis - integration testing
> 4. **API integration tests** - end-to-end testing with HTTP requests
>
> The type system catches most bugs at compile time. In Haskell, **if it compiles, it usually works**."

**Action**: Show load test results:
```bash
cd k6
k6 run cached-load-test.js --duration 10s
```

**Speaker:**
> "We also did load testing with k6. With caching enabled, we handle **over 10,000 requests per second** on a single instance. The performance is incredible because Haskell compiles to native code and the runtime is optimized for concurrent operations."

---

### **[6:30 - 7:15] Documentation & Developer Experience** (45 seconds)

**Speaker:**
> "We invested heavily in documentation because **none of us knew Haskell before this project**."

**Action**: Open browser tabs showing:
1. GitHub Pages with Haddock docs
2. DEV-README.md
3. HASKELL-CHEATSHEET.md

**Speaker:**
> "We have three levels of documentation:
>
> 1. **Haddock docs** - Auto-generated API documentation deployed to GitHub Pages
> 2. **DEV-README** - Step-by-step guide for new developers with recommended reading order
> 3. **Haskell Cheat Sheet** - Quick reference for common syntax and patterns
>
> Plus, we created an annotated branch called `comments` where **every single line** has explanatory comments comparing Haskell concepts to Java and JavaScript. It's like having a tutor built into the code."

**Action**: Show annotated code example from `comments` branch.

---

### **[7:15 - 7:45] Production Readiness** (30 seconds)

**Speaker:**
> "This isn't just a learning project - it's production-ready."

**Visual**: Show GitHub Actions workflow or list features:

**Speaker:**
> "We have:
>
> âœ… **Docker Compose** for local development - Redis spins up with one command
> 
> âœ… **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD - automated testing and documentation deployment
> 
> âœ… **Comprehensive error handling** - No unhandled exceptions, all errors mapped to proper HTTP codes
> 
> âœ… **Caching strategy** - Redis with 1-hour TTL for performance
> 
> âœ… **Load testing** - Validated with k6, handles 10k+ req/s
> 
> âœ… **Type safety** - Compiler catches bugs before runtime
>
> The application is containerizable, scalable, and maintainable."

---

### **[7:45 - 8:00] Closing - Key Takeaways** (15 seconds)

**Speaker:**
> "To wrap up - three key takeaways:
>
> 1. **Haskell's type system** prevents entire classes of bugs that would be runtime errors in other languages
> 
> 2. **Functional programming patterns** like pure functions and explicit error handling make code easier to reason about and test
> 
> 3. **Clean architecture** works beautifully in Haskell - each layer has clear responsibilities and the code is highly maintainable
>
> The learning curve is steep, but the benefits in code quality and reliability are worth it. Thank you! Questions?"

## ðŸ’¡ Backup Slides / Additional Topics (If Time Allows or Q&A)

### If asked: "Why not just use Python/JavaScript?"

**Response:**
> "Great question. Python and JavaScript are excellent for rapid prototyping, but Haskell gives us:
> - **Compile-time guarantees** - Many errors caught before deployment
> - **Better performance** - Compiles to native code, handles concurrency efficiently
> - **Fearless refactoring** - Type system ensures changes don't break anything
> - **No null pointer exceptions** - We use Maybe/Either explicitly
>
> For a learning project, Haskell taught us functional programming principles that make us better programmers in ANY language."

### If asked: "What was the hardest part?"

**Response:**
> "Definitely the **monad transformers** - understanding ReaderT and how to lift IO operations. But once it clicked, it made dependency injection so elegant. The second hardest was getting used to **lazy evaluation** and understanding when things actually execute."

### If asked: "Would you use Haskell in production?"

**Response:**
> "For specific use cases - absolutely. **Financial systems**, **compilers**, **data processing pipelines** - anywhere you need correctness, performance, and maintainability. Companies like Facebook, Standard Chartered, and IOHK (Cardano blockchain) use Haskell in production.
>
> For CRUD web apps with tight deadlines? Probably stick with what your team knows. For complex business logic that must be correct? Haskell is a great choice."

### If asked: "How long did this take?"

**Response:**
> "About [X weeks/months] total:
> - Week 1-2: Learning Haskell basics
> - Week 3: Building core algorithm and service layer
> - Week 4: Adding HTTP layer with Scotty
> - Week 5: Redis integration and caching
> - Week 6: Testing, documentation, and load testing
>
> Most time was spent learning - actually writing the code was faster than expected because the compiler guides you."

## ðŸŽ¯ Presentation Tips

### Body Language & Delivery
- **Energy**: Be enthusiastic but not rushed - you have 8 minutes
- **Eye contact**: Look at the audience, not just the screen
- **Pace**: Slow down for technical terms (monad, ReaderT, etc.)
- **Pauses**: After demos, pause to let it sink in

### Technical Execution
- **Have backup**: If live demo fails, have screenshots ready
- **Test beforehand**: Run through the entire demo 2-3 times
- **Clean terminal**: Clear history, use large font size
- **Close distractions**: Close unnecessary apps, silence notifications

### Common Questions (Prepare Answers)
1. "Why Haskell instead of [popular language]?"
2. "What's the learning curve like?"
3. "How do you debug Haskell code?"
4. "What happens if Redis goes down?"
5. "Can this handle production load?"
6. "How do you onboard new developers?"
